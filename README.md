# Pig Game

You’re a pig that has to defend your fellow pigs from attackers. You were bestowed with special powers from some aliens. Y’all are considered the most delicious in the world, so your enemies come from far and wide.

A 2D slide-scroller game in Phaser3, TypeScript, and React.

## How to play

Use right arrow key to move right, left arrow key to move left, and up arrow key to jump.

## Why I built it this way
- Built it in Phaser3, since I was comfortable with JavaScript and wanted a web game.
- Included React because I was expecting to use the game directly with a website. But my time was focused on the game, so I didn’t end up using this.
- All free assets as placeholders.
- Created the animations for the pig myself.


## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is required to install dependencies and run scripts via `npm`.

## Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm install` | Install project dependencies |
| `npm run dev` | Launch a development web server |
| `npm run build` | Create a production build in the `dist` folder |

## Writing Code

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` from your project directory. Then, you can start the local development server by running `npm run dev`.

The local development server runs on `http://localhost:8080` by default. Please see the Vite documentation if you wish to change this, or add SSL support.

Once the server is running you can edit any of the files in the `src` folder. Vite will automatically recompile your code and then reload the browser.
