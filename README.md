# Pig Game

This is a TypeScript React Phaser game where you play as a super-powered pig defending your pig brethren from humans who want to turn y'all into bacon.

The game is based off a Phaser Vite TypeScript template.

## How To Play

Use right arrow key to move right, left arrow key to move left, and up arrow key to jump.

## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is required to install dependencies and run scripts via `npm`.

## Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm install` | Install project dependencies |
| `npm run dev` | Launch a development web server |
| `npm run build` | Create a production build in the `dist` folder |

## Writing Code

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` from your project directory. Then, you can start the local development server by running `npm run dev`.

The local development server runs on `http://localhost:8080` by default. Please see the Vite documentation if you wish to change this, or add SSL support.

Once the server is running you can edit any of the files in the `src` folder. Vite will automatically recompile your code and then reload the browser.
